Create Script
=============

This script uses the Infrastruscture as code principle to automate the creation of a stack in AWS. In this 
script, a VPC , and EC2 and scurity groups are created. A stack is basically a collection of resources in AWS 
cloud.This is done in cloud fomation

Makes use of one cloudformation create stack command using Infrastructure as code:

Below is an example of how you would do manually:

#Where testSTACK is the name of the stack to be created in AWS
template body is our YAMl file with the stack parameters.

aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name testSTACK --template-body file://testcfn.yml --region us-east-1

Syntax::

create.sh testSTACK jenkins-server.yml ==>testSTACK -is the name of our stack
				       ==>jenkins-server.yml -is our parameter file with the logic,and commands to help automate the creation of a VPC, Internet Gateway, Security Group and an EC2 instance with Jenkins /docker and GIT installed in it
